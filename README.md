# Perceptron
The repository contains a Jupyter notebook that guides you through implementing a vanilla Perceptron. The implementation is broken down into simple functions. Each function implementation has a small unit test that can help you debug your code. A two dimensional synthetic dataset is used for training the algorithm. At the end of the notebook there is a function that can generate an animation that demonstrates how the perceptron algorithm learned the line that seperates the classes.
